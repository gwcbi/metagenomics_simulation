# Metagenomics simulation workflow
### Scripts to generate and process simulated metagenomics reads with MetaSim and Cope
The simulation is setup as follows:
- The median insert length of PE reads is 550nt;
- The probability of generating PE reads is 1 (ie, all simulated reads will be PE)
- Reads are simulated error-free
- 16 processors are used
